# 07: Apply a flake overlay with nixtamal

Apply the pinned [patchelf
overlay](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/blob/3e996dbef1fa0658012f8dd290bddcf0302acade/flake.nix)
to the consumer’s nixpkgs and build its added package:

```sh
nix-build
./result/bin/patchelf --version
```

Expect `patchelf 0.19.2`. `patchelf-new` is the Nix attribute name; the
executable remains `bin/patchelf`. Unlike 06, this builds the overlay recipe
with the parent package set instead of wrapping upstream’s prebuilt package
output.

The included Nixtamal archive pins and resolver are unchanged from 06.
flake-compat evaluates patchelf’s outputs; its default overlay is applied during
the parent nixpkgs import.

The manifest controls source selection. The `overlays` import argument controls
package construction, so applying this overlay requires no manifest or lock
changes.

Alternative considered: Modifying the generated resolver to return an overlaid
package set would mix fetching with consumption and be overwritten by
regeneration. The consumer owns this small application step.

Source pins, generated resolvers, seed files, and version records are copied
unchanged from [06-flake-package](../06-flake-package). No initialization or
pinner CLI is needed to build. For regeneration, follow 06’s maintenance setup
and use this directory’s `init.sh` in a disposable copy without its generated
files.

The upstream lock supplies helper functions for overlay evaluation. The selected
recipe uses the parent toolchain, while upstream’s package outputs keep their
own package set. The overlay adds `patchelf-new` alongside the parent’s existing
`patchelf`, without an input-sharing rule or lock rewrite.

`../../verify-07.sh` checks pins, upstream locks, matching overlay builds,
parent build dependencies, version output, and unchanged files in fresh copies
with spaces in their paths. It also compares with 06’s upstream package and
confirms that plain parent nixpkgs has no `patchelf-new` attribute.
