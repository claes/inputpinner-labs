# 07: Apply a flake overlay with manual

Apply the pinned [patchelf
overlay](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/blob/3e996dbef1fa0658012f8dd290bddcf0302acade/flake.nix)
to the consumer’s nixpkgs and build its added package:

```sh
nix-build
./result/bin/patchelf --version
```

Expect `patchelf 0.19.2`. `patchelf-new` is the Nix attribute name; the
executable remains `bin/patchelf`. Unlike 06, this builds the overlay recipe
with the parent package set instead of wrapping upstream’s prebuilt package
output.

The unchanged `pins.json` fetches the parent nixpkgs, patchelf, and flake-compat
sources. The adapter exposes `overlays.default`; importing parent nixpkgs with
it adds `patchelf-new`.

Hashes select the source trees, and the overlay argument selects how the parent
builds a package from those trees. These steps remain visible and independent.

Alternative considered: A hand-written replacement overlay could call the
upstream recipe, but would duplicate the upstream flake output. Reusing its
published overlay needs no extra library beyond the adapter already pinned in
06.

Source pins, generated resolvers, seed files, and version records are copied
unchanged from [06-flake-package](../06-flake-package). No initialization or
pinner CLI is needed to build. For regeneration, follow 06’s maintenance setup
and use this directory’s `init.sh` in a disposable copy without its generated
files.

The upstream lock supplies helper functions for overlay evaluation. The selected
recipe uses the parent toolchain, while upstream’s package outputs keep their
own package set. The overlay adds `patchelf-new` alongside the parent’s existing
`patchelf`, without an input-sharing rule or lock rewrite.

`../../verify-07.sh` checks pins, upstream locks, matching overlay builds,
parent build dependencies, version output, and unchanged files in fresh copies
with spaces in their paths. It also compares with 06’s upstream package and
confirms that plain parent nixpkgs has no `patchelf-new` attribute.
